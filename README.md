## Introduction

Welcome to the TimeTracker repository! This project was developed as part of a C# seminar subject at Brno University of Technology. TimeTracker is a desktop application designed to help users manage their projects, track time spent on activities, and improve productivity.

The goal of this application is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for project management, allowing users to create and join projects, create activities with fixed start and end times, and keep track of their progress. TimeTracker is built on the .NET framework and utilizes various technologies to provide a robust and efficient experience.

## Features

TimeTracker offers the following key features:

1. **Project Management**: Create and manage multiple projects with different tasks and activities.
2. **Activity Tracking**: Track time spent on activities with fixed start and end times.
3. **User Collaboration**: Collaborate with other users by joining their projects and contributing to activities.
4. **Data Persistence**: Store project and activity data using an SQLite database.
5. **Modern UI**: Utilize the MAUI framework to create a modern and visually appealing user interface.
6. **Design Patterns**: Implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for separation of concerns and the Facade design pattern for simplified database access.

## Technologies

The TimeTracker application is built using the following technologies:

- **MAUI Framework**: The MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) framework is used to develop cross-platform user interfaces for desktop applications.
- **Entity Framework**: Entity Framework is utilized as the object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for database access and management.
- **MVVM**: The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern is implemented to separate the application's logic from its user interface.
- **SQLite**: SQLite is used as the database engine to store and manage project and activity data.
- **Facade Design Pattern**: The Facade design pattern is employed to provide a simplified and unified interface for accessing the SQLite database.
